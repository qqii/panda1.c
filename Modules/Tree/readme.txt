    The program will begin with an empty contacts list. You can add new contacts using E and search for them using S.

Word Count Program:
  Usage:
    > ./count.o <filename>
  Comments:
    This program is basically the same as the program created last week but using an binary tree for searching instead of a linked list or hash table. 
    I have not added comparison to a linked list or hash table since those modules did not hide the existance of nodes and would need to be updated.
