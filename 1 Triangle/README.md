# Coursework 1: Triangle

A program that classifies triangles into the following categories:

```
Equilateral     (all sides equal)
Isosceles       (two sides equal)
Right           (has a right angle)
Scalene         (sides unequal, but no right angle)
Flat            (no area)
Impossible      (lengths don't add up)
Illegal         (lengths are invalid)
```

## Usage

1. `make` (you should see 50 tests pass)
2. `./triangle.o <integer> <integer> <integer>`
